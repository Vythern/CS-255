Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client?  
DrivePass is an online service used to help train students that are struggling with learning to drive and / or earning their drivers license.  
They offer online test taking, study material, as well as online instructors to help walk the customers through their trouble.  
The client was Liam, the owner of DrivePass.  

What type of system did they want you to design?  
They wanted to design the aforementioned online test taking / study tool described above.  

What did you do particularly well?
I think that the gantt chart was the part that I understood and implemented the best, it was probably the most useful piece of work.  
I believe that in the future I'd actually consider using these unlike a large portion of the other aspects such as the uml activity diagrams.  


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that the work I did most poorly had to do with the uml activity diagrams and whichever one had the stick figures as icons.  
Those felt kind of useless to me, and as a software engineer I just feel that the class diagram was infinitely more useful to describe the function
of drivepass and its internal systems.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I mean, if you're getting paid to design something, you probably are trying your best to meet the client's expectations.  
What else would you be trying to do?  Take the idea and run with it, develop it without getting paid?  It's tough to come up with an idea
like that which is worth not getting paid for these days.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My personal approach is very analytical, I approach it the same way that I write an essay.  I research the requirements and different features first.  
Once I know what needs to be developed I chunk it into, well, running with the essay analogy, paragraphs, parts of a whole, and develop the features one at a time.
